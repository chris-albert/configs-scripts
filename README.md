Here is a place i have my mac scripts and configs.

* bash functions
    - Add `source ~/git/configs-scripts/profile` to your `~/.profile` to load this profile
* IntelliJ settings
    - ./intellij_settings.jar
* git configs
    - Run `ln -s ~/git/configs-scripts/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig`

I would imagine that you can just link to these files so that i can keep them backed up in git.

Mac Programs:
* Alfred - Cmd + Space
* Moom - Shift + Ctrl + Enter
* Docker
* Dropbox
* 1password
* Shimo
* ITerm2
* Divvy
* git
* IntelliJ
* nvm `brew install nvm` cloning from git doesn't work on Mac
* sbt
* Kalidescope
* Atom
* Little Snitch
* MySql Workbench
* Tower

TODO:

alfred is backed up in dropbox

* b -> chrome bookmarks
* gh -> git hub autocomplete
* j -> jenkins jobs autocomplete
* p -> open iterm to project
* hotkey cmd + shift + d -> scala test diff with kalidescope
* uuid -> gen and paste uuid
* t -> tower
* g -> google autocomplete
* slk -> slack (dont really use, tooo slow)
