Here is a place i have my mac scripts and configs.

* bash functions
* IntelliJ color styles
* git configs and git autocomplete

I would imagine that you can just link to these files so that i can keep them backed up in git.

Mac Programs:
* Alfred
* Moom
* Docker
* Dropbox
* 1password
* Shimo
* Divvy
* git
* IntelliJ
* nvm
* sbt
* Kalidescope
* Atom
* Sublime
* Little Snitch
* MySql Workbench
* Tower

TODO:

* gh -> gh autocomplete
* j -> jenkins jobs autocomplete
* p -> open iterm to project
* hotkey cmd + shift + d -> scala test diff with kalidescope
* uuid -> gen and paste uuid
