Here is a place i have my mac scripts and configs.

* bash functions
    - Add `source ~/git/configs-scripts/profile` to your `~/.profile` to load this profile
* IntelliJ settings
    - ./intellij_settings.jar
* git configs
    - Run `ln -s ~/git/configs-scripts/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig`
    - Add bash git status https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt
* vim config
    - Run `ln -s ~/git/configs-scripts/vimrc ~/.vimrc`

I would imagine that you can just link to these files so that i can keep them backed up in git.

Mac Programs:
* Alfred - Cmd + Space
* Moom - Shift + Ctrl + Enter

* nvm `brew install nvm` cloning from git doesn't work on Mac
* sbt
* Kalidescope
* Atom
